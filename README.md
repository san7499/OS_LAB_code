2. Write a program to implement an address book with options given below: a) Create 
address book. b) View address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record. e) Modify 
a record. f) Exit 
3. Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. 
Main program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child 
process. Parent process sorts the integers using sorting algorithm and waits for child 
process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any sorting algorithm. Also 
demonstrate zombie and orphan states. 
4. Implement the C program in which main program accepts an array. Main program 
uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent 
process sorts an array and passes the sorted array to child process through the 
command line arguments of EXECVE system call. The child process uses EXECVE 
system call to load new program which display array in reverse order. 
5. Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Shortest Job First 
(Preemptive )  with different arrival time. 
6. Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Round Robin  with 
different arrival time. 
7. Thread synchronization using counting semaphores. Application to demonstrate: 
producer consumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex. 
8. Thread synchronization and mutual exclusion using mutex. Application to 
demonstrate: Reader Writer problem with reader priority. 
9. Implement the C program forDeadlock Avoidance Algorithm: Bankers Algorithm. 
10. Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: FCFS for frame size as 
minimum three. 
11. Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: LRU  for frame size as 
minimum three. 
12. Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms:  Optimal  for frame size 
as minimum three. 
13. FIFOS: Full duplex communication between two independent processes. First process 
accepts sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second 
process counts number of characters, number of words and number of lines in 
accepted sentences, writes this output in a text file and writes the contents of the file 
on second pipe to be read by first process and displays on standard output. 
14. . Inter-process Communication using Shared Memory using System V. Application to 
demonstrate: Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared 
memory segment and writes the message to the shared memory segment. Client 
process reads the message from the shared memory segment and displays it to the 
screen. 
15. Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle. 
16. Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SCAN  considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle. 
17. Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: C-Look  considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle.
